# Rock-Paper-Scissors Project
A rock-paper-scissors game that performs individual rounds between the user and computer.

## About the Project
This project is intended to showcase information processing and DOM manipulation. The user selects rock, paper, or scissors, which is then compared with the computer's choice. Each round announces a winner (or draw). The game ends and announces a final winner (or draw) once a player reaches five points.
* The RPS buttons' container listens for click events, recording the user's choice based on the chosen button.
* The computer's choice is randomly generated.
* Each round displays updated player scores and announces a round winner.
* A reset game button is presented once the final winner is announced.
