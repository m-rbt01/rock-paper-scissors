choice. The winner will be announced after the five rounds, based
on the player with the most points.

      Rock.
    * Computer choice is randomly generated, and returned by a 
      function.

      scores for both players.

                    INCREMENT the round
                ENDCALL
            IF one or both users reach 5 points THEN
                CALL display results
                    IF user score is greater than computer score THEN
                        DISPLAY that the user won the game
                    ELSE-IF computer score is greater than user score THEN

                    TOGGLE the reset button hidden class to show it 
                    TOGGLE the rps button selection hidden class to hide them
                ENDCALL
            ENDIF
        ENDCALL
    ENDLISTEN
    
    LISTEN for reset game
        CALL restart game function
            SET user score to 0
            SET cpu score to 0
            SET round back to 1
            RESET UI display elements
            TOGGLE reset button hidden class to hide buttons
            TOGGLE rps button selection hidden class to show buttons
