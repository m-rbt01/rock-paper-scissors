PROBLEM: Create a five-round Rock Paper Scissors game played by 
the user vs. the computer. The user must provide their choice, 
and it will be compared against the computer's predetermined 
choice. The winner will be announced after the five rounds, based
on the player with the most points. 
    * Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats
      Rock.
    * Computer choice is randomly generated, and returned by a 
      function.
    * User choice function is case-insensitive, prompting the
      user for their choice.
    * The program keeps track of the winner of each round with 
      scores for both players.
    * The winner of each round is announced.

PLAN:
    * UI - No user interface, program is executed on the console.
    * Inputs - User choice (String)
    * Outputs - 
        User choice (String)
        Computer's Choice (String), 
        User Score (number),
        Computer Score (number), 
        Round winner (String),
        Game Winner (string)
    * Process - 
        Get user choice,
        generate computers choice, 
        determine winner of each round, 
        update score board,
        display round winner, 
        determine the game winner, 
        display game winner.

ALGORITHM:
    FOR five rounds
        DISPLAY the current scores
        GET user choice
        CALCULATE the computer's random choice
        IF the user quits the game THEN 
            TERMINATE the game
        ENDIF
        IF both choices are the same THEN 
            DISPLAY draw
            RESTART the round
        ELSE-IF user choice is Rock AND computer chose Scissors,
        OR user choice is Scissors AND computer chose Paper, OR
        user choice is Paper AND computer chose Rock THEN
            INCREMENT user score
            DISPLAY that the user won the current round
        ELSE
            INCREMENT computer score 
            DISPLAY that the user lost the current round
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR
    IF user score is greater than computer score THEN
        DISPLAY that the user won the game
    ELSE-IF computer score is greater than user score THEN
        DISPLAY that the yser lost the game
    ELSE
        DISPLAY a game draw
    ENDIF
    CALL playAgain WHEN user clicks the reset button
        set user score to 0
        set cpu score to 0
        CALL playGame
